## The Challenge

Imagine you just started a new job managing order fulfillment.  You are taking over for Drew, who trained you how to manage customer orders.  Every time an order came in, Drew manually entered the information into spreadsheets:  the order number, order date, customer name, product details, and quantity.  Quite a time-consuming and error-prone manual process!  Even worse, only Drew had access to the spreadsheets, making Drew a bottleneck for entering orders or providing status updates and analytics to the team.  

On day one of your new role, your team members tell you that one of the product names is incorrect on all customer orders, causing confusion.  Some customers are cancelling their orders.  You investigate and learn that the source of the error is on the master product list, one of the spreadsheets Drew maintained.  Everyone agrees that correcting the product name on both the product list and all orders is a top priority. 

Before you have a chance to do that, the Vice President asks you who are the top customers and the top selling products for Q2 of 2019. That information does not seem to be readily available, and it will take you some time to sort through the spreadsheets to get it. 

You know there must be a better way to get things done and realize this is an opportunity for you to make a major impact on the organization.  

> You write down the following objectives:

> 1. **Eliminate inefficiencies.** Enable team members to enter orders and make the process simple and intuitive.
> 2. **Minimize effort to update data.** Find a way to correct the product name on both the product list and line items of all open orders quickly and easily.
> 3. **Share access to reports.** Enable management to access up-to-date analytics from their own computer or mobile phone.

You’ve decided to create a Quick Base app to achieve these objectives.  You know you’ll need the data from Drew’s spreadsheets. Drew sent you a link to where the spreadsheets are online, all you have to do is download them and get started.   

Click on the file names below to download Drew's spreadsheets to your computer.
