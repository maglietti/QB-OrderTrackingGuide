# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Quick Base getting started guide. This guide walks you through the process of creating a basic order management application in Quick Base. As you progress through the guide, you will experience the process of app creation while learning key concepts and skills. 

## Scenario

You are taking over for Drew who is moving to another position. Drew currently manages the process, enters data into spreadsheets, and is currently an integral part of the workflow in the office. The team has grown along with the success of the company and everyone wants to take this opportunity to evolve the manual process and remove the dependency on you to complete orders.

Right now, every time an order comes in, the information is manually entered into several spreadsheets:  the order number, order date, customer name, product details, and quantity are all individually typed in every time. Drew keeps the spreadsheets on a laptop, making Drew a bottleneck for entering orders, providing status updates, or producing analytics for management.  

Your team members tell you that one of the product names is incorrect on _all_ of the customer orders, and it is causing confusion.  Some customers are even cancelling their orders.  You investigate and learn that the source of the error is on the master product list, and instead of typing the information each time Drew has copy/pasted the product names into all of the orders.  Correcting the  product name in the product list and updating all of the existing orders is now your top priority.

In addition to fixing the product name in the orders, during the morning meeting, management asked for a report of the top customers and the top selling products for Q2. That information is not readily available, and it will take you some time to sort through the spreadsheets to build the report.

You recognize that the order management process has outgrown a manual spreadsheet based approach, so you set out to rebuild the process using Quick Base.  

## Goals

To stay foced, you write out a few notes about what yo are setting out to accomplish. 

> 1. **Eliminate inefficiencies.** Make it so other team members can enter orders while making the process simple and intuitive.
> 2. **Minimize effort to update data.** Find a way to correct product name in the product list and update the line items of all open orders.
> 3. **Create and share reports.** Give management access to up-to-date reports from their own computer or mobile phone.

Taking a recommendation from a friend, you decide to give Quick Base a try and see how well an App solves the problem. Drew sent you a link to where he posted the spreadsheets online, all you have to do is download them and get started.

Click on the file names below to download Drew's spreadsheets to your computer.
