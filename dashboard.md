# App Dashboard

Dashboards give people one convenient place to see or access key information. It is what people see when they first sign into an app. You can create different dashboards for different roles. 

## Add the orders summary report

## Add the customer by spend report

## Add the product by revenue report

## Add a create new order button

Add a button that lets users create new orders directly from the dashboard:

    1. Drag and drop the Button Bar widget from the top to a spot above the reports.
    2. A  popup window displays. At the top, there are three options for button type: New Record, Report, or Page. Leave the default value of New Record. 
    3. In the New Record dropdown, select Order. 
    4. Close this popup window.  
    5. Hover your mouse over the widget’s top right corner to make the gear icon appear. Select this gear and deselect Show a Title.

Add a button that lets users view a report showing all products:

    1. Drag and drop another Button Bar widget from the top to a spot to the left of the New Order button. 
    2. At the top of the popup window, select Report at the top.
    3. Set Report to Products > List All. 
    4. Close the popup window.
    5. Put your cursor over this List All button to make the pencil icon appear. Select this pencil icon and change the label to All Products and select the green checkmark to save the change.
    6. Hover your mouse over the widget’s top right corner to make the gear icon appear. Select this gear and click the blue swatch to change the button color to another color, like magenta. 
    7. Close the popup window. 
    8. Select Save.
