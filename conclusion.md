{: .label .label-yellow}

_You faced a lot of challenges when you took on this new role of managing orders. You inherited a process that was inefficient, prone to errors, and heavily dependent on one person manually updating multiple spreadsheets and sharing reports with management. You took time to understand the existing process, identified specific problems to address, and defined clear objectives for improvement. And without any help from your IT department, you were able to build a custom app using Quick Base to achieve those objectives. Look at what you accomplished._
